  A bar chart displaying the number of qualified countries, with teams like Brazil, Italy, and Argentina topping the list.

   A donut chart showcasing World Cup winners and the number of times each country won. Brazil leads with 5 titles.

  A stacked column chart that visualizes goals scored, matches played, and qualified teams per tournament year â€” helping understand how the competition has evolved over time.

  A host country breakdown showing which nations hosted the event and how many times, with Brazil, France, and Italy hosting multiple times.
This project was designed to practice data visualization techniques in Power BI, focusing on report layout, color themes, interactivity, and storytelling. The design uses a bold dark theme for clarity and impact, emphasizing key metrics through clean visuals.
